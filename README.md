Project description:
There is a toy character-level NanoGPT model pretrained on web-crawled Question Answering (QA) data. It can only handle some simple QA problems, such as “what’s your name?⎯ My name is John". As math problems were not included during pretraining, the NanoGPT cannot give correct responses to this type of questions. Hence, we will use the Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm DPO in this project to teach this toy NanoGPT to solve some simple algebra and arithmetic problems

This project was worked on jointly by Chiang Wen Xi, Cheng Xinya and Samuel Chong
